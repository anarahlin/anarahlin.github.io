<p style="text-align:left">Professional Appointments
<p style="text-align:left">September 2016 – present
	Associate Ornithologist, resident and migratory bird research. Illinois Natural History Survey, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL. Performed resident and migratory bird surveys, focusing on threatened, endangered, and sensitive species, along urbanization and land-use gradients as part of biological monitoring associated with Illinois Tollway construction activities. Wrote technical reports on bird survey activities. Wrote grants and initiated environmental DNA research to search for rare and cryptic wetland birds of Illinois, focusing on rails. Collaborated with Audubon Great Lakes scientists on rail species distribution modelling research. Initiated research on red-headed woodpecker declines in Illinois as a Master Bander. Managed hourly technicians, contract employees, and staff biologists. Supervisor: Dr. Michael Dreslik.

<p style="text-align:left">April 2016 – July 2016
Biologist, Black-Backed Woodpecker Research. The Institute for Bird Populations, Point Reyes Station, CA. Established and conducted multi-species point counts and habitat assessments in the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade ranges as part of USFS Management Indicator Species population monitoring. Additionally, used playback to survey recently-burned mixed conifer forests for Black-Backed Woodpeckers, a species of conservation concern, in order to better manage fire and logging impacts on birds. Supervisors: Dr. Rodney Siegel, Bob Wilkerson. 

<p style="text-align:left">September 2014 – March 2016
Graduate student, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL. Studied interactions between Hume’s Leaf Warbler, sawfly larvae, and Himalayan Birch in Manali Sanctuary, Himachal Pradesh, India, to tease apart the effects of biotic and abiotic factors which limit the altitudinal distributions of these three alpine species, and to understand how responses to extreme weather events and predation impact fitness of migratory birds. Supervised and trained multiple field technicians to conduct bird, insect, and phenology surveys, safely mist-net and measure birds. Processed over 200 birds, conducted playback with competing Phylloscopus warbler species, and piloted reciprocal transfer experiments with birch saplings. Used program MARK to model nest survival rates for 11 years of field data. Committee members: Dr. Trevor Price (chair), Dr. Stephen Pruett-Jones, and Dr. J. Timothy Wootton.

<p style="text-align:left">March 2014 – August 2014
	Bird Banding Intern, Point Blue Conservation Science (formerly PRBO), Palomarin Field Station, Point Reyes, CA.

Conducted area searches, mended nets, and recorded phenological observations in collaboration with Nature’s Notebook, a citizen science program. Conducted outreach presentations and tours to school groups and members of the public, and conducted independent project using mark-recapture data to measure Wrentit body size shifts due to climate change. Gained certification at the Bander level from the North American Banding Council (NABC, nabanding.net) demonstrating ethical bird-banding practices and my ability to use molt patterns, plumage characteristics, and morphological measurements to accurately age and sex a variety of passerines and near-passerines.
