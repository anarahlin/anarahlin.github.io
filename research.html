		<p>My research focuses on the impacts of land use, urbanization, and climate change 
		on migratory birds, cryptic wetland birds, and woodpeckers.

						<h2>Climate change and 
							<br>
							<br>aggression</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Temperature influences behavior and aggression. We are interested in understanding how climate change influences competition and aggression between species, and how rising temperatures differentially influence endotherm behaviors. </p>

						<h2>Detecting birds using
							<br><br>environmental DNA</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Cryptic wetland birds, such as rails, are difficult to detect in the field, leading to a poor understanding of their distributions and basic life histories. We use environmental DNA methods and metabarcoding to improve detections of multiple cryptic wetland bird species and better understand the timing of their breeding seasons and migrations. </p>

						<h2>Multi-species occupancy
							<br><br>modelling</h2>
					</header>
					<p>We are investigating how urbanization and forest structure drive migratory bird diversity and stopover habitat use. Link to jsc329's package goes here <a href="link_goes_here">hyperlink_text_description_goes_here</a></p>

						<h2>Red-headed woodpecker 
							<br><br>conservation</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Red-headed Woodpecker populations are declining in the northern part of their range. We are investigating how urbanization, food availability, and competition affect woodpecker reproductive success.</p>
