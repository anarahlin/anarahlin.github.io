						<h3><br>Lincoln Land Bird Banding Laboratory</h3>

					<p>I am lucky to have volunteered since 2017 with a tight-knit bird banding community at the Lincoln Lab Bird Banding Laboratory in Springfield, IL. This banding station is run by Vernon Kleen during spring and fall migration, and by Tony Rothering during the MAPS breeding bird season. One of my favorite things about this station is that it is built on the campus of Lincoln Land Community College, and we teach visiting studets and community members about migratory birds and the importance of long-term mark-recapture studies, often reaching out to groups with very little experience with birds.

						<h3><br>Wild Things</h3>

					<p> I was blown away by the thousands of naturalists, artists, birders, and scientists that attended the 2019 Wild Things conference in Chicago. My collaborator Stephanie Beilke (Audubon Great Lakes) and I gave a talk about wetland bird conservation and ongoing eDNA research. I was astounded by both the level of interest in research by the public and heartened by the diversity of this conference. Short, accessible, and affordable conferences like these are a fantastic way to talk to citizen scientists and interested people of all ages and backgrounds, and a great way for the broader community to rally around science.
