						<h3><br>Lincoln Land Bird Banding Laboratory</h3>
					</header>
					<p>I am lucky to have volunteered since 2017 with a tight-knit bird banding community at the Lincoln Lab Bird Banding Laboratory in Springfield, IL. This banding station is run by Vernon Kleen during spring and fall migration, and by Tony Rothering during the MAPS breeding bird season. One of my favorite things about this station is that it is built on the campus of Lincoln Land Community College, and we teach visiting studets and community members about migratory birds and the importance of long-term mark-recapture studies, often reaching out to groups with very little experience with birds.

						<h3><br>Using environmental DNA to improve bird detections</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Cryptic wetland birds, such as rails and bitterns, are difficult to detect in the field,
					leaving us with a poor understanding of their distributions and basic life histories. 
					We are developing environmental DNA sampling methods to improve detections of multiple cryptic 
					wetland bird species. Improved detections will help us better understand the timing of breeding and
					migration for these enigmatic species, and help us understand how they respond to wetland management.
