I am an ornithologist and conservation biologist working at the Illinois Natural History Survey. My research focuses on the impact of land use and urbanization on migratory birds. I am using environmental DNA and metabarcoding methods to detect cryptic wetland birds, especially rails, to track their migrations and habitat use. I also research mechanisms causing red-headed woodpecker declines.
