	My research focuses on integrating spatial, temporal, and behavioral data to better understand how to conserve declining migratory bird species and woodpeckers. I also spend time building bioinformatic pipelines to analyze metagenomics data of wetland birds, and am slowly dipping my toes into using Bayesian modeling in my work. I collaborate with researchers at Audubon Great Lakes, the National Audubon Society, and the University of Illinois.
		
<br><br>I periodically hire technicians to help with fieldwork during spring and fall migration. If you would like to collaborate on a project or be considered for a field technician position, please email me.
