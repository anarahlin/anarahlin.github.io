My work focuses on integrating spatial, temporal, and behavioral data to better understand how to conserve declining bird species. I also spend time building bioinformatic pipelines to analyze metagenomics data and am slowly dipping a toe into Bayesian modeling.

<br>I collaborate with researchers at Audubon Great Lakes, the National Audubon Society, and the University of Illinois. I also periodically hire field technicians to help with fieldwork during spring and fall migration. Please contact me if you would like to work on a project together.
